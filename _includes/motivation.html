                    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Tesla stock (TSLA) has always been a volatile story, the company's economics are very challenging and 
                        there is no telling what Musk will say or do at any given time. This makes Tesla's stock a big attraction for share sellers.

                        <br>
                        In this study, our main hypothesis is that Elon Musk has an influence on Tesla's stock market.
                        First let's take a look at the major swings Tesla's stock price experienced, two periods pop out: June 2016, August 2018.
                        Then we explore the quotations of Elon Musk during these periods. 
                        From the quotations in the dataset we discovered that the 30th of june 2016, tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode.
                        The 7th of august 2018, Elon Musk tweeted he had "funding secured" to take the company private at 420$, then on the 27 September 2018, 
                        Elon Musk settled with the SEC over allegations that he had mislead investors with his tweet where he announced the potential privatization of the company. Adding even more fuel to the stock, 
                        Musk emailed the employees saying Tesla is "very close to achieving profitability". 
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        All these events may explain the sudden change in Tesla's stock price. This make us think about the potential possibility 
                        of building a model to predict Tesla's stock using the quotations of Elon Musk, through this blog we will determine to which 
                        extent our idea is realistic.
